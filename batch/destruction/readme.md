This will make your pc crazy. Only try this on a Virtual Machine. I build a kill switch in it it works only with the Killswitch: KillSwitch="C:\User%USERNAME%\Desktop\kill_switch.txt" If you delete the kill switch the mw will stop and you only have to deleate the register entries. Only educational purpose !!!

It will never stop... The User where you start the mw will be destroyd if you don't activate the kill switch !!!
